# Learning day
Each tuesday is a learning day at the Perception for Physical Interaction Laboratory. In his repository we gather our ideas and toy examples from this event. If anyone at the PPI lab is proud of his work and want to share his knowledge with the community -- this is the best place to do it.

# How to contribute
In order to add your repository here the best thing to do is to contact [this guy](https://github.com/mbed92) and he will add your repository as a submodule here.
